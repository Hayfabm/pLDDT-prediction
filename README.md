# pLDDT-prediction

deepchain.bio | Prediction AlphaFold pLDDT score

## pLDDT conda environment

From the root of this repo, create a virtual environment:
```
conda create --name pLDDT python=3.7 -y
conda activate pLDDT
```

you will need to manually install Bio-transformers by running:

```pip install bio-transformers```

## Overview 

Protein structures can provide invaluable information, both for reasoning about biological processes and for enabling interventions such as structure-based drug development or targeted mutagenesis. To frame that importance, they would fold into complex three-dimensional shapes. Thus, knowing how proteins fold is both difficult and absolutely costly, and time-consuming. Thanks to AlphaFold, we now have 3-D structures for virtually all __(98.5%)__ of the proteome. Alphafold produces a per-residue estimate of its confidence on a scale from 0 to 100 __"pLDDT"__ corresponds to the modelâ€™s predicted score on the IDDT-C alpha metric. To put this in perspective, we plan to predict pLDDT scores for a given protein sequence and, therefore we can estimate how mutagenesis can be confident in terms of pLDDT score.
